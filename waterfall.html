    Umbrella Falls is a sparkling cascade getting down from a height of 500 feet, best observed from a footbridge that connects the falls and dam, especially during monsoon. 
    <br>The reason why it is called Umbrella is because of its location, under the Wilson Dam, and the force by which the water falls on the naturally placed rocks that give an impression of an umbrella.<br> Apart from being a tourists attractions, the waterfall is a prominent source to generate electricity.<br><br>
    Umbrella Falls is located close to the iconic Arthur Lake of Bhandardara; spotting it is quite easily. One can hire a taxi or take personal car to reach the waterfall.

    With a height of 170 feet, Randha falls, the third largest in Maharashtra, is quite renowned for being the main source of hydropower.
    <br> Make a point to go few steps down to the pond of the waterfall, and reward yourself with an exquisite dip. <br>If not swimming then savor the view the milky white water gushing down in full vigor through the craggy landscapes. Don't forget to try some snacks from the nearby shacks.
    <br><br>Roads to Randha Falls are smooth and wide but if traveling by personal car then be little cautious as they might be slippers during winter, and monsoon due to fog, and rain, respectively. If not personal car than take a bus to reach here.<br><br>
    One can visit the famous waterfalls that are close to Randha Falls like Arthur Lake and Umbrella Falls. Also consider a visit to the Ghorpada Devi Temple, located quite close to the waterfall.  </p><br>
